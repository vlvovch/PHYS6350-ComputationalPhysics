# PHYS6350 Computational Physics (Spring 2025)

This repository contains the lecture notes and computer code for the graduate course PHYS6350 Computational Physics taught at the University of Houston taught in Spring 2025.

The course is designed for graduate/advanced undergraduate physics students.
The focus is on the concepts behind the numerical methods used in computational physics over the implementation. For this reason, most of the code is in Python and uses Jupyter Notebooks for presentation. 
For the same reason, many standard routines (such as linear equation solvers) are reimplemented.


## Textbooks
There is no assigned textbook but the following textbooks can be useful:
- [**Computational Physics**](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Physics-Mark-Newman/dp/1480145513) by Mark Newman (Some parts of this text are available on the authorâ€™s website: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/index.html)
- [**Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing, Third Edition**](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-3rd-Scientific-Computing/dp/0521880688/) -	 by W.H. Press, et al.

Many of the problems and examples are taken from the first book, these are referenced in the lecture notes where applicable.
