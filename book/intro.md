# Introduction

This material is based on the graduate course <a href="https://publications.uh.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=33&amp;coid=158842">PHYS6350 Computational Physics</a> that I taught at the <span style="color:red;">University of Houston</span> in Spring 2023 and Spring 2025.

The course presents the basic concepts of computational physics and numerical methods, their examples, and applications to physics problems. 
The course is designed for graduate/advanced undergraduate physics students.
The focus is on the concepts behind the numerical methods used in computational physics over the implementation. For this reason, most of the code is in Python and uses Jupyter Notebooks for presentation. 
For the same reason, many standard routines (such as linear equation solvers) are reimplemented.

The full course materials are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vlvovch/PHYS6350-ComputationalPhysics), including the [sample code](https://github.com/vlvovch/PHYS6350-ComputationalPhysics/code) and [slide decks](https://github.com/vlvovch/PHYS6350-ComputationalPhysics/slides).

This book consists of the following chapters:
